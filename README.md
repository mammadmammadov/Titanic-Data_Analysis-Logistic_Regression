# Titanic Dataset Analysis ðŸš¢

This project focuses on cleaning the Titanic dataset and building two logistic regression models to predict survival: one implemented from scratch and another using built-in functions from popular machine learning libraries.

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`titanic.csv`) includes the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- **Name**: Passengerâ€™s name.
- **Sex**: Passengerâ€™s gender.
- **Age**: Passengerâ€™s age.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Passenger fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Usage
